Media Share,"There is an unlimited number of videos, PDFs, etc. that can be used for education, training, instruction, or professional development.
Finding and curating them into playlists, integrating with existing workflow, and sharing with others is time consuming, inefficient, and often limited by ‘vendor lock-in.’
Media Share is a productivity tool that saves time, requires no training to use, and does not limit how or where content can be used.

Search KWIC Concordance,"This is a Windows program for generating and searching a KWIC concordance of a document (""KWIC"" = ""Keywords in Context""). A KWIC concordance is a list of the different words occurring in the document, with each instance of each word shown in context (that is, within a phrase). Word frequency is shown. Context size is user-definable, anything from 3 to 19 words long. The software acts on text files and on MS Word docx files, skipping over ""stop"" words.  The concordance can be displayed alphabetically or by frequency, and can be written to a file.
After a concordance is generated it may be searched for specified keywords.  You can search also for word patterns (such as ""s?t*ing"").  You can search for a specified word (or word pattern) which has another specified word (or word pattern) close to it (that is, within the same context).
There is no limit on the size of an input file. You can tell the program to allow or disallow hyphenated words or words with numerals. You can tell it to include only words which occur with more than a specified frequency. Stop words may be read from a file. This software may be used with text in languages other than English, in particular, with French, German, Italian, Spanish and Latin text.

""TwXplorer helps make Twitter search more useful by helping users find and explore chatter about topics that interest them."" (from twXplorer website)
How does twXplorer do this? First, a Twitter account is required. The user signs into twXplorer through his Twitter account and is directed to the TwXplorer page. He then types a term into the search box. This term can be a hashtag (#digitalhumanities), a mention (@dhnow) or simply a word.
TwXplorer then trawls Twitter for the 500 most recent results of the search term, and presents them to the user. It omits unedited retweets, instead explaining that, for example, 380 tweets and 120 retweets were found. The page is divided into several columns: the left column displays the latest tweets from the results; the center column, the most common terms; the right column, the most popular hashtags and the bottom column, any links mentioned in the tweets. To narrow down his results, the user can click on any subset of terms or hashtags. He then only sees results within that specific term. TwXplorer also offers the functions of taking a snapshot of the results and sharing them.

"Canva ""The Amazingly Simple Graphic Design Software""","I would consider myself to be a visual learner.  I surround myself with gifs and memes, and when it comes to academia I gravitate towards infographics, mind-maps and charts to observe key pieces of information.  So it’s not surprising that I chose a graphics based tool to review.  In my area of study (Digital Humanities and IT), we cross paths with a myriad of visualisations every day, in many different formats.  I think then it is prudent that we should be able to create our own graphics in order to convey, share or focus our knowledge or opinions, even if we have a lower level of computer literacy.



Enter “Canva.com”.  Canva has deemed itself the “Amazingly Simple Graphic Design Software”, and it is definitely true to its word.  It is an open source software and its simplicity in my opinion is much needed.  I am familiar with Photoshop, Gimp, Photoplus and InDesign but as most of us know Photoshop et al, can be convoluted, time consuming and of course very expensive.  



Canva was created in 2012 by Melanie Perkins of Sydney, Australia.  The idea for Canva stemmed from the fact that whilst teaching graphic design to her students, they struggled with the basics.  Perkins then formed a partnership with Cliff Obrecht and from there they initially created Fusion Books - an online design tool for designing high school yearbooks.  They later went on to launch Canva after realising that the technology they developed had even more potential. 



The website as mentioned previously, is www.canva.com.  Its interface, as it should be, is bright and simple, and very encouraging.  Canva may be used for designing posters, profile pictures, Facebook banners, infographics and pie/bar charts.  It revolves entirely around controls such as drag-and-drop, which makes adding, removing, and editing elements onto your canvas a cakewalk.  Canva stores a vast amount of text and images in its repository, the one slight snag is that you will have to pay $1 per image once your design is downloaded (which is still rather inexpensive).  Also, having said that, the software allows the user to upload many personal images for manipulation, so downloading the software’s images is not completely necessary.  When it comes to its colour scheme, at first glance Canva provides a palette of up to about 8 colours, but if you’re after a specific colour or hue then the colour-picker provided may help with that and it even allows you to enter a hexadecimal code for that specific hue.  There are also video tutorials available upon launching your account of how to work your way around the website.  Users can also create videos and gif images which can then be uploaded to social media accounts.  Your work can then be saved and exported to PDF and PNG depending on what it is you have created. 



If you are a design pro, then you may find Canva a bit limiting in what it has to offer.  Canva is very much aware of this, as it never had the intention of taking over pro tools such as the aforementioned Photoshop or InDesign.  With Canva the everyday user has everything to gain and nothing to lose by utilising it, but the professional has nothing to lose and not much else to gain.  

Regardless of this, for the user who simply wants to make a flyer, poster, invitation or meme then Canva will be your best friend.  It helps the average user to overcome any design fears.  Canva employs designers and also reaches out to photographers and illustrators to share their works on the website for us to avail of.  It also provides creative inspiration via a stream of designs previously made by registered users, and this is why I feel it deserves recognition on DiRT.



Since its origination in 2012, Canva has been growing from strength to strength, opening an office in Manila in 2014 and eventually raising additional funds of approx. 6 million dollars in 2015.  It also gained new investors that year, including Hollywood actor Woody Harrelson.  From reading reviews about Canva the outlook on the entire software looks positive.  It also seems to be escalating in rank on many tech based websites.  Canva has since created a workplace version of their software, which allows for team collaboration on various potential projects.  Smart Company gave Canva a gleaming review and listed it number 5 out of a total 75 in its article: “75 Best Tools for Skyrocketing Business Growth in 2016”.  If you have access to internet and a computer you’re basically more than half way there to designing your first masterpiece.  Canva is a smart tool that everyone should experience, for the computer savvy and the not so computer savvy.

Heurist Data Manager / Visualiser / Publisher,"HEURIST  (http://HeuristNetwork.org) is an extremely flexible, end-user oriented, web-based data management system designed specifically for Humanities data. Developed since 2005, it has been in active use across many projects since 2009. It is available both as a free web service for researchers (hosted at the University of Sydney Data Centre) or for installation on a physical or virtual server (Open Source on gitHub). 



Researchers can design, create, manage, analyse, visualise and publish their own richly-structured database(s) through a simple web interface, without the need for programmer(s). Quite complex databases can be built in a few hours by borrowing structures and vocabularies published by other users. Databases can be designed and built incrementally, as existing data are not affected by changes in structure. Databases created by Heurist are stored in MySQL with a repeatable structure facilitating sustainability and independent access by other software. 





Advanced features include record linking, graph structure, drill-down facet searches, rule-based queries, custom reports, linked map-timelines, network visualisation, normalised spreadsheet import, crosstabulation, XML feeds, XSLT transforms. The team provides initial email and skype assistance for project setup at no cost, and special customisations at modest cost.





Heurist is applicable in many domains including History, Archaeology, Anthropology, Cultural Research, Linguistics, Media Studies etc. It handles everything from text, tags and categories, through networks of rich relationships and offset annotations, to images, video, spatial data and dating (including non-western systems and dating uncertainty).





Sophisticated searches (including faceted and rule-based) can be saved, organised and rendered as layered interactive maps, timelines, network visualisations, crosstabulations, lists, custom reports, XML and XSLT transforms, all of which can easily be printed or embedded (live) in a website - Heurist provides the html code required to embed results in a web page or CMS.

Addtionally, a number of supervised machine-learning methods are available via the function classify() (Delta, support vector machines, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, nearest shrunken centroids). The rolling.delta() function analyses collaborative works and tries to determine the authorship of fragments extracted from them. The oppose() function performs a contrastive analysis between two given sets of texts: among other things, it generates lists of words significantly preferred and avoided by one or more authors in comparison to the texts by another author (or a set of them).

DH Press,"DH Press (originally called diPH) is a toolkit conceived as an easy-to-use WordPress plugin which allows potentially every kind of user to visualise and mashup historic and geographic information, documents and various types of multimedia content to develop digital humanities project.
The user cannot start from the toolkit itself, as the first step to set up a project, when the toolkit is already installed, is a CSV import. This means that the raw information has to be processed first, through any software like Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheet, following some conventions dictated by the toolkit, and once completed must be exported in CSV format. The file can then be imported into DH Press.
At this point, the user finally has full control over the data. First, the toolkit needs to be informed of what kind of data is in each column, as it can handle various types, such as Short Text, Long Text, Lat/Lon, Date, and Link. The steepest learning curve resides here, in the data management part, as the database must be set up very carefully, and fixing any problem later is complex. This does not mean that new users cannot approach the tool, but some basic research on data management is required to make correct use of it.
After setting up all this fields, called “motes” in the toolkit, a legend can be assigned to each of them, for example a field called “city” might contain, through multiple entries, ten different cities, and to each of those will correspond the colour chosen by the user. It is also possible to assign icons or png images instead of colours.
A single control panel then allows the user to create, set up and manage multiple visualisations of different kind, and in each of them the user can choose which information to display and how. This part is the most useful and is really straightforward.
The last section of the control panel lets the user set up custom fields for data and run a test of the whole project, and outputs detailed error information.
Following the training page, http://dhpress.org/training/, it is possible to take advantage of a pre-existing database, which can be used to quickly set up a project, so that one can instantly work on the main control panel. There is a detailed google document that guides the user through the process step by step, and also offers an even more detailed annex. A couple of hours is enough to go through all of it and get the necessary information to use it correctly. Then, any view can be quickly set up and customised in any desired way.
Overall, this toolkit is quite stable, reliable, user-friendly after the first entry barrier and gives you a varied set of tools to visualise and display a large amount of data in a neat, organised manner.

Inkscape,"Inkscape is a ‘find’ an oasis of creativity.   It is open-source software which allowed me to take my first step in my  journey towards creating 2D graphics.

 

Currently, I am a student and as a requirement of my course, I have to write a thesis in addition to making a digital artefact.   I wanted to find software to create image and visualisations that would help me in my research.   Often image is not considered  a viable option in research but It is my opinion that the nature of research will change especially as society becomes more visually-centred through the use of digital.   Thus, one of the changes will be the advantage of using computer animated stimuli in research.    Images formulate meanings, and often more succinctly than words.  It is my intention to combine the written word and 2D graphic image.   Therefore, I am relieved to find software like Inkscape to help me develop my theory without having to buy expensive software.



Inkscape is a professional vector graphics editor suitable for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and it is a credible alternative to Adobe Illustrator for a student or anyone else on a tight budget.



The company itself, also appealed because it has similar ethics as I have in that it is non-hierarchical and encourages newcomers to actively participate.  It is good to find a software company with an ethos you can be comfortable with.  I have discovered that Inkscape Development tries to be a collaborative endeavour between the company and the user and strongly encourages newcomers.   My on-line presence would normally be minimal but I have ventured into their on-line community in order to participate in their discussions and forums and I am enjoying the engagement.   There is also a Inkscape Wiki site.



As a fledging to the world of digital it has to be said that  my lens extends to the basic functions of Inkscape, but on saying that I was more than happy with the basic functions which allowed me to create a 2D character.  This drawing would not win any awards but nevertheless I was very impressed by this first attempt. 

 

What I liked



•	It’s free

•	A clear and user-friendly single document interface.

•	A choice of flexible tools: pencil, Bezier curve tool, spiral tool and brushes with various widths.

•	The on-line manual on the interface  was reasonably self-explanatory.  It came in very useful 

        when I got stuck.

•	A good selection of colour swatches, filters and extensions. 

•	The use of trace on imported bitmaps. 

•	Layer  transparency effects.

•	The main tools palette is aligned vertically down the left hand side in a way that uses the

         minimum of space.

•	The import and export  in various file formats: SVG, AI, EPS, PDF PS and PNG.

•	Designed to be extensible and customised with add-ons.



 I was surprised that the interface seemed fairly intuitive and self-explanatory.     With one click on the icon, the tool is highlighted and described. 

  

It has to be said  though, that it does require time and patience to get the hang of the ‘pencil’ and ‘berzier curve tool’ but I did anticipate that this would be the case.   In addition, I found the ‘node’ tool quite hard to operate.  As this tool allows for intricate reshaping I found it difficult with small items. However, Inkscape deserves the time taken to learn all the rich functions and hopefully when I become more confident my opinion will be more positive. 

There is a vast array of official and external video tutorials to assist an user.   However, I preferred to take a more hands on approach and spent time simply trying out the various functions.   I had good fun designing 3D boxes, eclipses and circles.   The palette which houses ‘fill’ and ‘stroke’ can be displayed in a collapsible format making it easy to colour the object and I enjoyed ‘grouping’ the items together to make an array of designs.



If the company’s main objective is to provide a user-friendly suite of applications and an easy to use desk-top then they have certainly fulfilled that criteria. 



The website is clear and concise with a lay-out which is easy to navigate and garner information.  A badly designed website can put me off the product but I had no worries on this score as I found the colour scheme easy on the eye.



Inkscape is downloaded on my computer and I hope that through the mountain of reading and assignments I can get the time to become more confident and competent in its use.  I strongly believe that Inkscape should be on DiRT Directory as it is a viable option for scholarly research for those in universities, colleges and schools; and an option for individuals starting up as freelance researchers, in addition to the potential use for all creatives, business people or anyone that wants to make their documents much more interesting to read.

Ainm.ie,"For the purposes of review, I have chosen a tool called 'Ainm.ie'. It is an online database which consists of approximately 1700 biographies for individuals who have made a significant contribution to the Irish language over the past 5 centuries. My goal is to use it as a resource for my dissertation ("" 'Sun Tzu Is Ainm Dom': Ireland's Language and Its Military Diaspora""). To that end, I have been searching Ainm.ie for figures connected to both the Irish language and military history. So far, I have searched for individuals based on the following criteria:
1: Each candidate must have a connection to Irish military history (a field which is at times difficult to separate from overall military history).
2: Definition of a connection: a person of Irish descent who has engaged in military service on behalf of a foreign power in an army, marine (in the case of Britain or the US), naval or air capacity.
3: If an individual is related to a figure who has engaged in such activities, this is also acceptable.
4: Also counted amongst my choices are individuals who have aided war efforts in civilian capacities, e.g. propaganda campaigns, recruitment  drives, diplomacy or intelligence work.
5: They must also have made a positive contribution to the Irish language, or have used it to some extent during wartime.
6: The (surprisingly large) number of people with no Irish connection but who have served in military conflicts will not be included for the purposes of this particular study.
7: Those who may have served in the Irish army are not mentioned as I do not count them as part of the military diaspora.
Based upon said qualifications, I have chosen 90 people (so far). In order to understand my choice of Ainm.ie as a research tool, it is first necessary to understand my reasons for choosing my research topic. I want (insofar as it's possible) to tell the story of Irish speakers at war, because it's something which I feel has been neglected. Because this is a very much a niche topic, it has proven impossible for me to rely solely on conventional digital tools. Simply typing the phrase 'Irish (or Gaelic) speakers in the British (or American/French/, etc.) army' into Google, Google Scholar or DuckDuckGo does not guarantee a result. It has even been necessary for much of the time to consult non-digital resources. Since my goal has been to create a digital artifact using any and all means at my disposal, I have had to content myself with a lack of digital tools at my disposal. 
Ainm.ie has, however, been an exception due to the sheer volume of information it contains. Here is a breakdown of how the site's functions relevant to my work:

Search engine

This is the most basic function on the sight and it has the standard function of any website search engine. Beneath it, there is another search button for more specialized searches involving 'keywords' and 'phrases'. I have used this many times for military terms such as 'soldier(s)', 'war(s)', 'military', 'regiment(s)', 'brigade(s)', etc. The site is mostly in Irish. Changes in spelling and grammar are important when deciding what phrase to search for. Take for example if one searches for the phrase briogáid (the Irish for 'brigade' in the nominative case), the same results will usually be yielded if he/she uses bhriogáid (the dative case equivalent).

Alphabetical list

This enables the user to search for individuals by the first letter of their surname. Highly useful, but a distinction must be made between ""Ó"" and ""O' "" at the start of some names, and also between names rendered wholly in Irish or English.

Themes

Searches can be carried under the following headings: placenames, works, the Gaelic League, educational institutions, professions and political parties. In my view, this section has its drawbacks because the part dealing with placenames is limited insofar as one cannot search for South Africa, even though references are made to the Boer War. The 'professions' search is also problematic, because although one can find 'SMYTHE, William James' under the title 'soldier', because he is tagged as such in his entry's information box (see next entry), having spent a good deal of his life in the Royal Artillery. Ó FLAITHEARTA, Liam cannot be found under same, because even though he fought in the Irish Guards during the First World War, he is not tagged as a soldier. The reasons for such distinctions are not made clear. Ó Flaithearta left the army after the war. Ó CATHÁIN, Seán (1889–1948) was in the US army at the same time, and left the army after the war, but he is tagged with Smythe.

Information box

Each individual biographical entry contains a box on the left-hand corner containing basic details such as place of birth, gender, school, higher education and writer. The place of birth section because it provides a link to 'logainm.ie', a website which provides information in both English and Irish regarding Irish placenames. Some entries also contain a profession section, where those with similar professions are usually tagged together, but with some exceptions (see previous entry)
In spite of the few disadvantages outlined above, I have found 'Ainm.ie' to be the best digital for my subject matter so far. As it is my intention to create a digital artifact on the links between the Irish language and military history, it has been an invaluable aid for biographical details.

nodegoat,"nodegoat is a web-based data management, analysis & visualisation environment.
Using nodegoat, you can define, create, update, query, and manage any number of datasets by use of a graphic user interface. Your custom data model autoconfigures the backbone of notegoat's core functionalities.
Within nodegoat you are able to instantly analyse and visualise datasets. nodegoat allows you to enrich data with relational, geographical and temporal attributes. Therefore, the modes of analysis are inherently diachronic and ready-to-use for interactive maps and extensive trailblazing.
In order to share the functionalities of nodegoat with the scholarly community, scholars and research institutes are invited to use nodegoat for their own research purposes. Send an email to info@lab1100.com to discuss using nodegoat for your research projects.
nodegoat allows scholars to build datasets based on their own data model and offers relational modes of analysis with spatial and chronological forms of contextualisation. By combining these elements within one environment, scholars are able to instantly process, analyse and visualise complex datasets relationally, diachronically and spatially; trailblazing.
nodegoat follows an object-oriented approach throughout its core functionalities. Borrowing from actor-network theory this means that people, events, artefacts, and sources are treated as equal: objects, and hierarchy depends solely on the composition of the network: relations. This object-oriented approach advocates the self-identification of individual objects and maps the correlation of objects within the collective.
nodegoat can host multiple projects with different relational data models and manage users with various privileges and project affiliations. With the integration of version history and dynamic discussion fields, users can work on and discuss different aspects of the datasets without losing any data in the process.
Scholars define their own data models freely and dynamically with no limitations to relational structures or depths. This model allows for filtering and analysis of complex relations between objects in your datasets. Paths between different objects can be analysed to expose relational networks. As each object can be supplemented with geographical and temporal attributes, diachronic geographic and social visualisations of your datasets are directly available.
nodegoat is capable of processing complex queries. In nodegoat you query your data by means of filtering functionalities. These filters are based on the data model that has been set up and are as complex or as simple. Also, these filters will go as deep as the connections that can be made within the data model. Each filter can be stored and re-used by other users and can be used for various functionalities within a research project. For instance, once a filter has been stored a user can ‘follow’ a filter and be notified when an object matching this filter has been added or modified.
nodegoat allows scholars to define in-text references to any object in your dataset. Example: should you include a transcript of a meeting, you can 'tag' people or organisations mentioned in this transcript. The database will save this reference as a relation between the object of the person/organisation and the object of the meeting.
nodegoat is built to be fully platform independent. It is possible to import complex and relational datasets from file and to export clean relational datasets in standard JSON or XML formatting.

It’s an adaptable storytelling tool that is ideal for highlighting then/now stories that explain slow changes over time (growth of a city skyline, regrowth of a forest, etc.) or before/after stories that show the impact of single dramatic events (natural disasters, protests, wars, etc.).
JuxtaposeJS is free, easy to use, and open source. Almost anyone can use JuxtaposeJS, so long as you’ve got links to two similar pieces of media (hosted on your own server or on Flickr). Once you’ve got the links, all you need to do is copy and paste the URLs into the appropriate fields at Juxtapose.knightlab.com, modify labels as you see fit, add photo credits, and then copy and paste the resulting embed code into your site.
You’ve probably seen similar photo slider tools elsewhere. They work well, but we built JuxtaposeJS without relying on jQuery, which makes the tool more lightweight, flexible, and adaptable. It’s also accessible to any newsroom or journalist, regardless of technical skills.

It also offers some customization out of the box. You can modify the handle’s start position to highlight the area of change and choose to click the slider instead of dragging. It is responsive and works on phones and tablets with the touch or swipe of a finger.

Basement Waterproofing: Tips and Instructions,"What's worse than a leaking wall? A soaked basement! It is no doubt that a wet basement can be a nightmare for any home owner. Water exactly isn't a friend when it causes persistent leaks or dampness in the walls and basement of your home. If you have, by any chance, experienced the horrible phase of soaked and wet basement then it is probably in your best interests that you get your basement waterproofed. As you never know, when is the next time you find yourself in the same situation again? But there are number of ways in which you can tackle this problem and hiring a professional contractor for basement waterproofing is one solution.
The choice is yours- you can either hire professionals or seek professional advice such as the suggestions given below. Just find the ones which are most effective for your basement problems.What should you do when you first notice water in your basement? Start investigating outside the house. Your aim should be to find the manner in which water is making its way into your basement. Also make sure that the downspouts, gutters or any other drainage systems of your home are working effectively and doing its task of diverting the water away from your home. Keep the maintenance of your home in check- that's the key!
With basement waterproofing, each situation is unique. Any good contractor will agree to the fact that one size doesn't fit all. Avoid systems that are not specifically designed for the situation you have- that is quite preventive against any problem to occur in near future. Your contractor must know what each problem of basement water id unique and requires different solutions. Most of them occur due to a majority of factors and that makes it all the more essential to invest in a good basement waterproofing system.
The kind of basement waterproofing system you need to install depends upon your home's unique construction and situation including the kind of foundation system in place. It is also necessary that you know that many times just one repair isn't enough, you may have to go with a combination of approaches.It is one waterproofing method that many contractors do not recommend. According to them, a covering over a wall with leaks produces cosmetic solution if the source of leak isn't taken care of in time.
This basement waterproofing technique is mostly suited for concrete foundations as seepage is through walls and not floors. The basic masonry elements like bricks, cinder block or stone aren't exactly what you would want. However water can be prevented from entering into the wall or basement by injecting a polyurethane or epoxy. However, many basement waterproofing companies call it a Band-Aid solution.This technique involves excavating down the foundation wall footer (6 to 8 ft.) and installing a French drain system or installing drainage tiles and hence correcting the drainage system.

HT-Bookworm,"Bookworm is a tool that visualizes language usage trends in repositories of digitized texts in a simple and powerful way. It is a tool for culturomic exploration through the observation of chronological trends for words and phrases in large digitized collections of textual documents with metadata facets.

The world's great research libraries have, over time, carefully assembled a rich body of metadata pertaining to the books in their collections. Since the HTRC has access to volume-level metadata as well as volume-level content, we have constructed a Bookworm of the HathiTrust Non-Google-digitized public domain (NGPD) corpus. We felt that setting up Bookworm with a HathiTrust corpus would provides scholarly researchers with the means of exploring trends.

This tool enables scholars to discover new textual use patterns across the entire corpus. In the future, we plan to ingest the entire HathiTrust corpus and continue to identify appropriate metadata to use for the faceted browsing. This tool will be particularly useful to scholars interested in books that are still under copyright - which is the case for most books published after 1923. Although these books will not be available for reading or downloading online, working with individual words and phrases and tracking their occurrences through time will be useful to academic researchers, especially historians, sociologists and literary scholars.

John Unsworth has noted that a fundamental goal of the humanities is appreciation: ""by paying attention to an object of interest, we can explore it, find new dimensions within it, notice things about it that have never been noticed before, and increase its value"" (2004). Shifting from traditional close reading to a large-scale view of text presents a profound discomfort for humanities scholars, due to the difficulty in retaining the same sensitivity to what is actually contained in the works being studied. HTRC-Bookworm will function as a link between quantitative analysis (distant reading) and close reading. According to Frederick Gibbs and Daniel Cohen, ""any robust digital research methodology must allow the scholar to move easily between distant and close reading, between the bird's eye view and the ground level of the texts themselves"" (2011). This is what HTRC-Bookworm intends to accomplish (within the limitations of applicable copyright laws.)

Current limitations and future improvements:

The current instantiation (the alpha version) of the HTRC-Bookworm is set up to work with only 250,000 out-of-copyright volumes from the HathiTrust NGPD corpus. Overall the HathiTrust has more than 11,000,000 volumes in all their corpus, consisting of 420 billion pages.

As a demonstration we have selected some metadata for use with this smaller corpus, but we are open to feedback on improvements to this metadata.

Our plan is to ingest the larger HathiTrust corpus and to allow facets to be selected based on HTRC worksets.

Gerbil,"Gerbil is a generic framework for visualization and analysis of multispectral and hyperspectral data that strives to both bring new innovations in analysis capabilities and be of use in a wide range of hyperspectral data applications. In a nutshell, Gerbil lets you…
explore a multispectral or hyperspectral image before processing it,
apply common computer vision algorithms adapted to hyperspectral data,
cluster and label image pixels for your application scenario,
assess your own algorithms via high-dimensional data visualization,
use an intuitive interface for teaching multispectral imaging and reflectance analysis.
One example application for Gerbil is finding hidden information in multispectral scans of old manuscripts or art pieces.

BibSonomy,"BibSonomy is a social bookmarking and publication-sharing system. It aims to integrate the features of bookmarking systems as well as team-oriented publication management. BibSonomy offers users the ability to store and organize their bookmarks and publication entries and supports the integration of different communities and people by offering a social platform for literature exchange.

Both bookmarks and publication entries can be tagged to help structure and re-find information. As the descriptive terms can be freely chosen, the assignment of tags from different users creates a spontaneous, uncontrolled vocabulary: a folksonomy. In BibSonomy, the folksonomy evolves from the participation of research groups, learning communities and individual users, organizing their information needs.

Publication posts in BibSonomy are stored in the BibTeX format. Export in other formats such as EndNote or HTML (e. g. for publication list creation) is possible.

The service was developed by a team of students and scientists working at the Institute of Knowledge and Data Engineering and is hosted by the University of Kassel in Germany.

TRAViz,"One of the substantial tasks in the ﬁeld of textual criticism is called collation, which is the cautious comparison of various editions of one and the same text. The traditional approach of a humanities scholar is to put the texts of several editions next to each other and mark the differences among the textual entities (e.g., sentences, sections, chapters). Since this is an extremely laborious approach many Digital Humanities projects investigate tools that support the humanities scholars with computational methods.
TRAViz is a JavaScript library that was developed within the Digital Humanities project eTRACES. It generates visualizations for Text Variant Graphs that show the variations between different editions of texts. TRAViz supports the collation task by providing methods to:
- align various editions of a text
- visualize the alignment
- improve the readability for Text Variant Graphs compared to other approaches
- interact with the graph to discover how individual editions disseminate

1) check the number of results (how often the chunk appears in Google Books or the Web); 

2) compare the number of results (if your selected chunk appears more or less frequently than suggestions from online);

3) see examples in context (display several examples of how your selected chunk is used in different texts); 

4) find words in context (see which words are used most often in your context, which you specify in your text by a star. For example, 'research should * this issue' will give you a list with 'research should address this issue', 'research should explore this issue', 'research should examine this issue', etc.); 

5) find synonyms in context (see which synonyms of a word are used most often in your context, with you specifying the word you want synonyms for by two stars. For example: 'a *difficult* situation' will suggest 'an awkward situation', 'a serious situation', 'an embarrassing situation', etc). 



The app works with a small popover which mean you can activate it from whatever writing tool you're using. No need to change windows - no interruption of your workflow.

Ptolemaic,"Ptolemaic is a computer application for music visualization and analysis written in the Java programming language. The software is designed to aid in the analysis of all types of Western music using established analytical techniques, including tonal functional analysis (Harrison 1994), pitch-class set analysis (Forte 1973), hierarchical linear analysis (Schenker 1935, Jones 2002), tonal pitch-space analysis on the Tonnetz (Riemann 1915), pitch-class set analysis (Forte 1973), and transformation analysis (Lewin 1987). Musical works and excerpts may be opened and saved using the de-facto standard music notation interchange format, MusicXML. To assist in analysis, Ptolemaic can display the music on a pitch/time graph, on a pitch-class/time graph, on a step-class/time graph (also called a diatonic lattice) (Jones 2002), on the Tonnetz, or using filtered point-symmetry (Douthett 2008). Pitch classes and chords are color coded so that the user can easily correlate them across each graph. The benefit of having a software tool to visualize and perform certain analysis tasks is in automating processes that are normally time-consuming for the musician, thus allowing the music scholar to focus on the musical issues, rather than the technical issues of graphing, and calculating chord classes. Ptolemaic provides useful ways of visualizing a piece of music and tools for gaining more information about that music, so that the user can efficiently make informed musical decisions about the music and preserve that analysis for future study.

NewRadial (INKE),"NewRadial is an interactive visualization environment that uses an adapter system to display and combine content from remotely-served or locally situated databases.  Although initially designed for use with image-based databases, NewRadial’s capabilities have been extended to handle the manipulation and annotation, in a visual field, of text-based databases.  This  adaptive ability makes it ideal for use with literary works, and—given its web-based functionality--ideal for collecting, associating and displaying independent databases together in the same visual field for use by a particular knowledge community.  
The NewRadial prototype encourages three types of work:
1.	 A simple search, sorting and manipulation of database objects in a visual field for the purposes of early scholarly inquiry and curiosity-based research
2.	Initial, raw and in-process commentary on connections and associations between database objects.  Within the database’s visual field, scholars can add comments on such correlations, thus starting conversations, discussions and debates relating to such ideas.  These discussions are hosted and archived by the NewRadial server.
3.	Larger edition projects in which a community is able to centralize and sort specific selections from a larger database.  NewRadial can be used to construct these curated environments, browse such environments, and (if desired) encourage secondary scholarship to proliferate in and around such projects.

Frontend – The Frontend module allows users to edit WordPress content from the front end of your website – no Dashboard required. Participad modifies the Edit links on your posts and pages so that, instead of leading to the Dashboard, the static content of your post is swapped with an editable Etherpad window.
Notepad – The Notepad module enables a new WordPress Post Type called Notepads. Notepads are collaborative note-taking documents, which can optionally be linked to existing static posts or pages. Participad provides several shortcodes and widgets that make it easy to create new Notepads from the front end of your website.

Editors' Notes,"Editors' Notes is an open-source, web-based tool for recording, organizing, preserving, and opening access to research notes, built with the needs of documentary editing projects, archives, and library special collections in mind.
Projects that work closely with documents—researching, contextualizing, and ordering them—invariably produce massive amounts of thorough research notes which are too often locked away in filing cabinets or the minds of editors and curators, never to be seen by anyone. The Editors' Notes project is a collaboration between the editors of the Stanton-Anthony Papers, the Emma Goldman Papers, the Margaret Sanger Papers, and the Labadie Collection which aims to preserve those research notes in a way that makes them useful to future scholars and interested minds.
Research teams can use Editors' Notes to manage their research and note-taking. Project administrators can assign research tasks to other team members, and they can control who has permission to edit their project's notes. 
Notes can be organized around documentary sources or thematically around topics (or both). Users can browse by topic, search full text, and filter using bibliographic metadata. Documents can be annotated with bibliographic metadata, topic keywords, and textual notations. Researchers can also upload scanned images of documents into the zoomable interface. Researchers can annotate specific passages in document transcripts. Annotations, like other notes, can include bibliographic metadata and topic keywords and are fully searchable. In addition to creating annotated transcripts, researchers can upload scanned images of documents, which can be viewed in a zoomable interface.
New accounts are by invitation only. Request an invitation. Editors' Notes is currently in limited beta release (Nov 10/14)

Annotations can also be used to modify the rendition of the audiovisual document, thus providing virtual montage, captioning, navigation... capabilities. Users can exchange their comments/analyses in the form of Advene packages, independently from the video itself.
The Advene framework provides models and tools allowing to design and reuse annotations schemas; annotate video streams according to these schemas; generate and create Stream-Time Based (mainly video-centred) or User-Time Based (mainly text-centred) visualisations of the annotations. Schemas (annotation- and relation-types), annotations and relations, queries and views can be clustered and shared in units called packages. Hypervideo documents are generated when needed, both from packages (for annotation and view description) and DVDs (audiovisual streams).

scrubber -- strips tags, removes stop words, applies lemma lists, and prepares texts for diviText

diviText -- cuts texts into chunks in one of three ways, count words, exports the results

treeView -- builds dendrograms and saves the output as .pdf or xml in phyloXML format

The Lexomics web site site contains extensive documentation and video tutorials.
Note: Lexomics has been replaced Lexos, which offers an integrated workflow and additional functionality.

WebLicht,"WebLicht is a service-oriented architecture (SOA) for creating annotated text corpora. Development started in October 2008 as part of CLARIN-D's predecessor project D-SPIN, and further development and enhancement of WebLicht is an important goal of CLARIN-D, aiming to make WebLicht a fully-functional virtual research environment.
WebLicht employs chains of RESTful web services. Each web service encapsulates a certain linguistic tool. For example, users can access as a web service the query component of a corpus, a format converter, a tokenizer, a tagger, or a parser. Translation between the input format specific to some tool and the WebLicht information interchange format TCF (see below) is performed by a web service wrapper. Each web service adds at least one layer of annotation encompassing the work of the tool encapsulated by that service. The output of a chain of WebLicht services is an automatically analyzed corpus in the form of an XML document.
To do this, each WebLicht service must be able to use a common interchange format that all the other services can also process. CLARIN-D's Text Corpus Format (TCF), serves this purpose. It is broadly compatible with existing related interchange formats like Negra, Paula, or TüBa-D/Z, and format-specific converters allow interchange between them.
WebLicht can be accessed only with a valid DFN-AAI/Shibboleth-based account or a local Tübingen account.

ANNIS,"ANNIS is an open source, cross platform (Linux, Mac, Windows), web browser-based search and visualization architecture for complex multi-layer linguistic corpora with diverse types of annotation. ANNIS, which stands for ANNotation of Information Structure, was originally designed to provide access to the data of the SFB 632 - “Information Structure: The Linguistic Means for Structuring Utterances, Sentences and Texts”. It has since then been extended to a large number of projects annotating a variety of phenomena. Since complex linguistic phenomena such as information structure interact on many levels, ANNIS addresses the need to concurrently annotate, query and visualize data from such varied areas as syntax, semantics, morphology, prosody, referentiality, lexis and more. For projects working with spoken language, support for audio / video annotations is also required.
Data is often annotated using both automatic taggers/parsers and a growing set of manual annotation tools (e.g. EXMARaLDA, ELAN, annotate/Synpathy, MMAX, RSTTool, Arborator, WebAnno, Atomic), ANNIS provides the means for visualizing and retrieving this data. Pepper is used to import the multiple annotation formats into ANNIS.

The VARD 2 software uses techniques derived from modern spell checkers to find candidate modern form replacements for spelling variants found within historical texts. The user can choose to process texts manually, selecting a candidate replacement offered by the system; automatically, allowing the system to use the best candidate replacement found; or semi-automatically, training the tool on a sample of the corpora.
The tool is designed specifically for Early Modern English spelling variation, but it can be used to deal with possibly any form of spelling variation, in any language, by plugging in your own dictionary and spelling rules.
Various related publications are available detailing the tool and its uses. And a full userguide is available.

T-PEN (Transcription for Paleographical and Editorial Notation),"Extensive set of tools to allow collaborative transcription of manuscript pages in TEI-compliant XML.
Features of T-PEN through version 1.2 [from project blog]
Zoom Tool in Transcription User Interface: Holding CTRL+SHIFT will result in a magnified image of the current line being transcribed.
Magnifying Tool in Full Page View: Click on ""Magnify"" button at the top right of the browser window and a magnifying glass tool will appear as the mouse pointer. Click on the same button to dismiss the tool. The magnifying tool is also available in the Compare Page feature.
Create a Project “Pipeline” to the outer world: In partnership with The Carolingian Canon Law Project (CCL), T-PEN developed a model for enabling users working on transcription projects in T-PEN to export their work to a larger, external project. In this instance, the CCL prepared for T-PEN an XML-markup template (XML button set) that may be used for all transcriptions destined for the CCL database. Users identify their T-PEN projects as destined for the CCL, and when the transcription is complete, they can submit it from T-PEN to the CCL project. The CCL receives notification of the stable URL in T-PEN that the CCL can (either manually or by automation) use to extract the designated transcription from T-PEN’s data store. Other projects interested in creating their own pipeline should contact T-PEN via t-pen.org
T-PEN Administration: T-PEN administrator can clear registration requests that have not been approved (ones that were mostly generated through internal testing).
Transcription UI: The previous line text will scale to the size of the screen. When on the first line of the page, available text from the last line of the previous page will be shown.
Visual Cue for Closing Tag Proximity (Transcription UI): Closing tags originating on previous pages are faded to indicate their distance from the current line of transcription.
Transcription Preview: The preview tool now applies a simple color filter to  to allow for a more clear view of your transcription.
New Project Option Tools: Users can add a French/English dictionary, a dictionary for Middle English and the Dictionary of Old English (subscription required). User can select which tools will be available in the Transcription UI’s i-frame. All tools can also be renamed by the user on the project management page.
Exporting Transcriptions: When exporting xml, users can select or deselect all the tags for inclusion at once.
Line History (Versioning): T-PEN distinguishes between all versions of any transcription line. Users can view previous versions of a given line. A change in a line is defined as addition or deletion of a single character (including white space) or modifications to the line parsing coordinates. A previous version can be selected to replace the current version. All versioning activity is recorded in the project log, which can be viewed on the project management page under the Collaboration tab.

Anastasia,"A software application that enables a user to search, manipulate and publish large SGML/XML documents. Anastasia was developed within an academic context to enable the manipulation of a single, large mark-up documents or a set of documents. It utilises two methods to interpret the structure of a mark-up document: First, it uses pattern-matching algorithms to process a hierarchical tree, similar to other XML software applications; Second, it interprets the document structure as a series of sequential 'events' which must be processed. The latter method, it is indicated, enables the application to perform processing activities that are difficult or impossible using the traditional approach. For example, it is able to build a view of textual content across element divisions and in different types of hiearchical structure and to allow the easy publication of user defined extracts from complex documents.

Where previously research groups would have to agree on a single environment to work collaboratively and share their data, the Bamboo Person Service can allow group leaders to indicate which scholars in the Bamboo Person Service should have access to a set of data, which will then become accessible for each of those people in the environment of their choosing.
The Bamboo Person Service also provides mechanisms for making contributions to projects easier to document (e.g. to present to tenure and review committees), by keeping track of which individuals are doing curation work on corpora, or contributing entries to Bamboo DiRT. As the Bamboo Person Service develops, it may be integrated with social and scholarly networking sites, to allow scholars to opt into sharing the tools they use, as part of their profile.
For tool developers and collection holders, the Bamboo Person Service can reduce the time and development effort that would go into writing custom authentication and authorization, and can facilitate quality control in crowdsourced projects by keeping track of the curator assessments made about the validity of individual users' additions.

Juxta presents several kinds of analytic visualizations. The most basic collation offers a split frame comparison of a base text with a witness text, along with a display of the digital images from which the base text is derived. Additionally, Juxta has several visualizations for the collation of multiple witnesses. Juxta can display a heat map of the textual variants that allows you to locate—at the level of any textual unit—all witness variations from the base text. You can also view the collation as a histogram, which displays the density of all variation from the base text and serves as a useful finding aid for variants in long documents. Finally, Juxta can output a lemmatized schedule (in HTML format) of the textual variants in any set of comparisons.

Designed to be Windows-only, but can be successfully run on Linux using Wine. Guenther Goerz has created a Mac version of the Image Markup Tool using Wine Bottler (it's a large download). Download it from the IMT Downloads page.
Features:
Supports ""a wide variety of image formats""
Saves markup information in conformant TEI P5 XML files
Create simple web output to display the annotated image in an interactive format
Simple, graphical interface lets you see the image and the fields for entering your markup notes
Annotations are visually represented on the image
View and hide different pieces of annotation as you work to see overlap or remove visual clutter
Allows knowledgeable TEI users to add additional TEI markup tags to their annotations
Allows access and manipulation of standard schema used, as well as creation of additional schema
Can handle multiple images in one file
Advantages:
Does for images all the wonderful things that XML markup does for text
Program checks XML for well-formedness and provides some basic assistance in automatically correcting ill-formed XML
Menu command for creating zip packages (containing image file, XML markup file, and associated schema files) provides an easy solution for moving projects
This tool also allows you to easily create thumbnails of a whole image or one annotated part of an image--one less task to perform in a separate image editing tool
Disadvantages:
Editing done to Image Markup's XML files in an external editor may not be preserved: Image Markup Tool ""will not guarantee to preserve XML code which is added to one of its files in an external editor (although it will try)"" 
Web output provides only a starting place for web display, and is not a one-stop shop for a finished web product
Tips:
Although the program documentation states that little or no user experience with XML markup is needed, it would be advisable to have, at the minimum, some familiarity with the basic concepts of markup (an introductory understanding of HTML, for instance).
If you are interested in manipulating schemas, they are presented as ODD files (rather than schemas) which are then used to generate the schemas

Picasa,"Picasa is an image organizer and viewer for organizing and editing digital photographs that includes an integrated photo-sharing website. 
For organizing photos Picasa has file importing and tracking features, tagging, facial recognition, and collections for sorting. It offers basic photo editing functions including color enhancement, red eye reduction, cropping, and adding text to images. Other features include slide shows, printing, and image timelines. Picasa does not store the photos you view or edit, it simply looks at folders on your computer to find photos to display. It can display the file types you tell it to from the folders you tell it to search. When editing images in Picasa your original files are never altered. You can choose to save your edits and Picasa will create a new version of the photo, leaving the original intact. 
Images can be prepared for external use, such as e-mailing or printing, by reducing file size and setting up page layouts. There is also integration with online photo printing services. Picasa uses picasa.ini files and IPTC Information Interchange Model keyword data (JPEG files only) for tracking keywords for each image. 
The following file types are supported in Picasa (for Windows):
Photos: .jpeg, .tif, .tiff, .bmp, .gif, .psd (Photoshop), .png, .tga, and selected RAW formats.
Movies: For general playback: .mpg, .mod, .mmv, .tod, .wmv, .asf, .avi, .divx, .mov, .m4v, .3gp, .3g2, .mp4, .m2t, .m2ts, .mts, .mkv. For several of these file types, the correct software is required for playback. 
For use in Movie Maker: .avi, .asf, .wmv, .mpg, .m2t, .mmv, .m2ts
Audio (for slideshows and the Movie Maker): .wma and .mp3 
Animated GIF files will not animate in Picasa
