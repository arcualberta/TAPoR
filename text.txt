This is a Windows program for generating and searching a KWIC concordance of a document ("KWIC" = "Keywords in Context"). A KWIC concordance is a list of the different words occurring in the document, with each instance of each word shown in context (that is, within a phrase). Word frequency is shown. Context size is user-definable, anything from 3 to 19 words long. The software acts on text files and on MS Word docx files, skipping over "stop" words.  The concordance can be displayed alphabetically or by frequency, and can be written to a file.
After a concordance is generated it may be searched for specified keywords.  You can search also for word patterns (such as "s?t*ing").  You can search for a specified word (or word pattern) which has another specified word (or word pattern) close to it (that is, within the same context).
There is no limit on the size of an input file. You can tell the program to allow or disallow hyphenated words or words with numerals. You can tell it to include only words which occur with more than a specified frequency. Stop words may be read from a file. This software may be used with text in languages other than English, in particular, with French, German, Italian, Spanish and Latin text.

Topincs is a online database software. Given a data model, it allows
data to be recorded and files to be uploaded and annotated through forms,
data and files to be displayed and navigated through interconnected data sheets, and
all that searched in the index.
It overcomes the rigidity of relational databases by using semantic technology. In the simplest use case, a group of users can collaboratively edit information and upload files from any device with a web browser and an internet connection. Development time ranges between 1 and 8 hours.
By designing and implementing services, the data can be manipulated, transformed and aggregated through an virtual object oriented programming interface driven by the data model. This allows sophisticated use cases where different user groups with different rights are presented a completely different application working on the same database. In these cases development time ranges between 2 and 20 days.
A Topincs online database can be rented for a monthly fee. We provide all services related to an online database: data modeling, programming, and support. We have special rates for educational institutions. Topincs can also be used as a Platform as a Service where the dark art of Topincs modeling and development must be studied online. The underlying semantic technology, Topic Maps, is thaught there through hands on examples and will change your view on information technology.

This software  is for indexing and searching Word docx files, HTML files, XML files, text files or files of a similar kind (such as XML files) in any folder of a hard disk, CD-ROM, etc.
This program does not simply create a list of files or simply search for character strings in a file. It indexes every word in every file, and any file containing a particular set of words (or any of those words, or an exact phrase) can be found by searching for those words.  Indexed files can be edited lightly without needing to re-index.
This software consists of two integrated modules: 1. An index module which is used to create an index of the files to be searched. 2.  A search module which is used to search those files.
The index module is capable of indexing a hierarchy of over 1000 files, totaling over 20 MB, and containing over 50,000 different words. Even with that number of different words the search module returns results in a few seconds. The results of a search are displayed automatically in a text box or in your default web browser (with links to the files containing the words searched for).

"TwXplorer helps make Twitter search more useful by helping users find and explore chatter about topics that interest them." (from twXplorer website)
How does twXplorer do this? First, a Twitter account is required. The user signs into twXplorer through his Twitter account and is directed to the TwXplorer page. He then types a term into the search box. This term can be a hashtag (#digitalhumanities), a mention (@dhnow) or simply a word.
TwXplorer then trawls Twitter for the 500 most recent results of the search term, and presents them to the user. It omits unedited retweets, instead explaining that, for example, 380 tweets and 120 retweets were found. The page is divided into several columns: the left column displays the latest tweets from the results; the center column, the most common terms; the right column, the most popular hashtags and the bottom column, any links mentioned in the tweets. To narrow down his results, the user can click on any subset of terms or hashtags. He then only sees results within that specific term. TwXplorer also offers the functions of taking a snapshot of the results and sharing them.

I would consider myself to be a visual learner.  I surround myself with gifs and memes, and when it comes to academia I gravitate towards infographics, mind-maps and charts to observe key pieces of information.  So it’s not surprising that I chose a graphics based tool to review.  In my area of study (Digital Humanities and IT), we cross paths with a myriad of visualisations every day, in many different formats.  I think then it is prudent that we should be able to create our own graphics in order to convey, share or focus our knowledge or opinions, even if we have a lower level of computer literacy.



Enter “Canva.com”.  Canva has deemed itself the “Amazingly Simple Graphic Design Software”, and it is definitely true to its word.  It is an open source software and its simplicity in my opinion is much needed.  I am familiar with Photoshop, Gimp, Photoplus and InDesign but as most of us know Photoshop et al, can be convoluted, time consuming and of course very expensive.  



Canva was created in 2012 by Melanie Perkins of Sydney, Australia.  The idea for Canva stemmed from the fact that whilst teaching graphic design to her students, they struggled with the basics.  Perkins then formed a partnership with Cliff Obrecht and from there they initially created Fusion Books - an online design tool for designing high school yearbooks.  They later went on to launch Canva after realising that the technology they developed had even more potential. 



The website as mentioned previously, is www.canva.com.  Its interface, as it should be, is bright and simple, and very encouraging.  Canva may be used for designing posters, profile pictures, Facebook banners, infographics and pie/bar charts.  It revolves entirely around controls such as drag-and-drop, which makes adding, removing, and editing elements onto your canvas a cakewalk.  Canva stores a vast amount of text and images in its repository, the one slight snag is that you will have to pay $1 per image once your design is downloaded (which is still rather inexpensive).  Also, having said that, the software allows the user to upload many personal images for manipulation, so downloading the software’s images is not completely necessary.  When it comes to its colour scheme, at first glance Canva provides a palette of up to about 8 colours, but if you’re after a specific colour or hue then the colour-picker provided may help with that and it even allows you to enter a hexadecimal code for that specific hue.  There are also video tutorials available upon launching your account of how to work your way around the website.  Users can also create videos and gif images which can then be uploaded to social media accounts.  Your work can then be saved and exported to PDF and PNG depending on what it is you have created. 



If you are a design pro, then you may find Canva a bit limiting in what it has to offer.  Canva is very much aware of this, as it never had the intention of taking over pro tools such as the aforementioned Photoshop or InDesign.  With Canva the everyday user has everything to gain and nothing to lose by utilising it, but the professional has nothing to lose and not much else to gain.  

Regardless of this, for the user who simply wants to make a flyer, poster, invitation or meme then Canva will be your best friend.  It helps the average user to overcome any design fears.  Canva employs designers and also reaches out to photographers and illustrators to share their works on the website for us to avail of.  It also provides creative inspiration via a stream of designs previously made by registered users, and this is why I feel it deserves recognition on DiRT.



Since its origination in 2012, Canva has been growing from strength to strength, opening an office in Manila in 2014 and eventually raising additional funds of approx. 6 million dollars in 2015.  It also gained new investors that year, including Hollywood actor Woody Harrelson.  From reading reviews about Canva the outlook on the entire software looks positive.  It also seems to be escalating in rank on many tech based websites.  Canva has since created a workplace version of their software, which allows for team collaboration on various potential projects.  Smart Company gave Canva a gleaming review and listed it number 5 out of a total 75 in its article: “75 Best Tools for Skyrocketing Business Growth in 2016”.  If you have access to internet and a computer you’re basically more than half way there to designing your first masterpiece.  Canva is a smart tool that everyone should experience, for the computer savvy and the not so computer savvy.

When simple problem may require a unique solution to be solved, Complex problems behave differently and multiple solutions are sometimes necessary to solve them. On the contrary to simple problem that may not need further deepening, a complex problem may be broken up in multiple small ones that help us understand the big picture. Every branch of the issue tree represent a different aspect of the problem, problems can be decomposed this way until reaching the bottom line where solutions to the ultimate sub-issues are added. Eris Solver uses an interdisciplinary approach and users are allocated into six major areas of expertise

This software scans one or many Word DOCX, text and text-like files (e.g. HTML and XML files) and counts the number of occurrences of the different words or phrases. There is no limit on the size of an input text file. The words/phrases which are found can be displayed alphabetically or by frequency.  The program can be told to allow or disallow words with numerals, hyphens, apostrophes, underscores or colons, to ignore words which are short or which occur infrequently, and to ignore words (e.g., common words such as 'the', a.k.a. stop words) contained in a specified file.  It can also count only words or phrases in a specified list (optionally with pattern-matching).  Results can be exported to Excel for further processing. The program works with text in most European languages, and supports the use of regular expressions for specifying words/phrases to count.

This software scans a Word DOCX file or a text file (including HTML and XML files) with text encoded via ANSI or UTF-8 and counts the frequencies of different words. The words which are found and displayed can be ordered alphabetically or by frequency. Characters which can appear in words can be specified, so the program can be told to allow or disallow words with numerals, hyphens, apostrophes, underscores or colons, to ignore words which are short or which occur infrequently, to treat upper/lower case as significant or not, and to ignore words (e.g., common words such as 'this', a.k.a. stop words) contained in a specified file.  This software may be used with text in most European languages.  The language of the text is detected automatically and (if supported) the corresponding stop words file is optionally loaded.  Results can be exported to Excel for further processing.  There is also an Advanced Version with greater functionality.

OHMS (Oral History Metadata Synchronizer) inexpensively and efficiently enhances access to oral history by providing users with word-level search capability and a time-correlated transcript or indexed interview connecting the textual search term to the corresponding moment in the recorded interview online.
OHMS is an open source,  web-based application designed to improve the user experience you provide for oral history, no matter what CMS or repository you use.  There are 2 main components of the OHMS system
OHMS Application: The OHMS application is where the work is done.  This is the back-end, web-based application where interviews are imported, and metadata is created.  In the OHMS application transcripts are time-coded and/or interviews are indexed.  Upon completion, the interview record (including the synchronized transcript and/or time-coded index) are exported as an XML file.  When located on a web server, the OHMS XML file is what interfaces with your content management system through the OHMS Viewer.
 OHMS Viewer: The OHMS viewer is the user interface of ohms.   When an interview is called by the repository, the OHMS viewer loads, calling select interview level metadata and the intra interview level metadata created in the OHMS Application from the corresponding xml file.

HEURIST  (http://HeuristNetwork.org) is an extremely flexible, end-user oriented, web-based data management system designed specifically for Humanities data. Developed since 2005, it has been in active use across many projects since 2009. It is available both as a free web service for researchers (hosted at the University of Sydney Data Centre) or for installation on a physical or virtual server (Open Source on gitHub). 



Researchers can design, create, manage, analyse, visualise and publish their own richly-structured database(s) through a simple web interface, without the need for programmer(s). Quite complex databases can be built in a few hours by borrowing structures and vocabularies published by other users. Databases can be designed and built incrementally, as existing data are not affected by changes in structure. Databases created by Heurist are stored in MySQL with a repeatable structure facilitating sustainability and independent access by other software. 





Advanced features include record linking, graph structure, drill-down facet searches, rule-based queries, custom reports, linked map-timelines, network visualisation, normalised spreadsheet import, crosstabulation, XML feeds, XSLT transforms. The team provides initial email and skype assistance for project setup at no cost, and special customisations at modest cost.





Heurist is applicable in many domains including History, Archaeology, Anthropology, Cultural Research, Linguistics, Media Studies etc. It handles everything from text, tags and categories, through networks of rich relationships and offset annotations, to images, video, spatial data and dating (including non-western systems and dating uncertainty).





Sophisticated searches (including faceted and rule-based) can be saved, organised and rendered as layered interactive maps, timelines, network visualisations, crosstabulations, lists, custom reports, XML and XSLT transforms, all of which can easily be printed or embedded (live) in a website - Heurist provides the html code required to embed results in a web page or CMS.





Databases can easily be migrated later to a personal or institutional server. Since the data are stored in a standard MySQL database with a fixed and well-documented structure, the data can be accessed directly via SQL from most programming languages independently of Heurist.





Version 4.2 (Jan 2016 onwards) is available as a service via the Heurist website. Version 4 delivers a user-customisable interface of widgets, along with better mapping and visualisation. Existing version 3 databases are bidirectionally compatible with version 4.

The ‘Stylo’ package provides easy-to-use implementations of various established analyses in the field of computational stylistics, including non-traditional authorship attribution, genre recognition, style development (“stylochronometry”), etc. The package includes a number of explanatory methods provided by the function stylo() (multidimensional scaling, principal component analysis, cluster analysis, bootstrap consensus trees). Addtionally, a number of supervised machine-learning methods are available via the function classify() (Delta, support vector machines, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, nearest shrunken centroids). The rolling.delta() function analyses collaborative works and tries to determine the authorship of fragments extracted from them. The oppose() function performs a contrastive analysis between two given sets of texts: among other things, it generates lists of words significantly preferred and avoided by one or more authors in comparison to the texts by another author (or a set of them). (from: "Stylo: a package for stylometric analyses" by Eder/Kestemont/Rybicki)

DH Press (originally called diPH) is a toolkit conceived as an easy-to-use WordPress plugin which allows potentially every kind of user to visualise and mashup historic and geographic information, documents and various types of multimedia content to develop digital humanities project.
The user cannot start from the toolkit itself, as the first step to set up a project, when the toolkit is already installed, is a CSV import. This means that the raw information has to be processed first, through any software like Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheet, following some conventions dictated by the toolkit, and once completed must be exported in CSV format. The file can then be imported into DH Press.
At this point, the user finally has full control over the data. First, the toolkit needs to be informed of what kind of data is in each column, as it can handle various types, such as Short Text, Long Text, Lat/Lon, Date, and Link. The steepest learning curve resides here, in the data management part, as the database must be set up very carefully, and fixing any problem later is complex. This does not mean that new users cannot approach the tool, but some basic research on data management is required to make correct use of it.
After setting up all this fields, called “motes” in the toolkit, a legend can be assigned to each of them, for example a field called “city” might contain, through multiple entries, ten different cities, and to each of those will correspond the colour chosen by the user. It is also possible to assign icons or png images instead of colours.
A single control panel then allows the user to create, set up and manage multiple visualisations of different kind, and in each of them the user can choose which information to display and how. This part is the most useful and is really straightforward.
The last section of the control panel lets the user set up custom fields for data and run a test of the whole project, and outputs detailed error information.
Following the training page, http://dhpress.org/training/, it is possible to take advantage of a pre-existing database, which can be used to quickly set up a project, so that one can instantly work on the main control panel. There is a detailed google document that guides the user through the process step by step, and also offers an even more detailed annex. A couple of hours is enough to go through all of it and get the necessary information to use it correctly. Then, any view can be quickly set up and customised in any desired way.
Overall, this toolkit is quite stable, reliable, user-friendly after the first entry barrier and gives you a varied set of tools to visualise and display a large amount of data in a neat, organised manner.

Inkscape is a ‘find’ an oasis of creativity.   It is open-source software which allowed me to take my first step in my  journey towards creating 2D graphics.

 

Currently, I am a student and as a requirement of my course, I have to write a thesis in addition to making a digital artefact.   I wanted to find software to create image and visualisations that would help me in my research.   Often image is not considered  a viable option in research but It is my opinion that the nature of research will change especially as society becomes more visually-centred through the use of digital.   Thus, one of the changes will be the advantage of using computer animated stimuli in research.    Images formulate meanings, and often more succinctly than words.  It is my intention to combine the written word and 2D graphic image.   Therefore, I am relieved to find software like Inkscape to help me develop my theory without having to buy expensive software.



Inkscape is a professional vector graphics editor suitable for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and it is a credible alternative to Adobe Illustrator for a student or anyone else on a tight budget.



The company itself, also appealed because it has similar ethics as I have in that it is non-hierarchical and encourages newcomers to actively participate.  It is good to find a software company with an ethos you can be comfortable with.  I have discovered that Inkscape Development tries to be a collaborative endeavour between the company and the user and strongly encourages newcomers.   My on-line presence would normally be minimal but I have ventured into their on-line community in order to participate in their discussions and forums and I am enjoying the engagement.   There is also a Inkscape Wiki site.



As a fledging to the world of digital it has to be said that  my lens extends to the basic functions of Inkscape, but on saying that I was more than happy with the basic functions which allowed me to create a 2D character.  This drawing would not win any awards but nevertheless I was very impressed by this first attempt. 

 

What I liked



•	It’s free

•	A clear and user-friendly single document interface.

•	A choice of flexible tools: pencil, Bezier curve tool, spiral tool and brushes with various widths.

•	The on-line manual on the interface  was reasonably self-explanatory.  It came in very useful 

        when I got stuck.

•	A good selection of colour swatches, filters and extensions. 

•	The use of trace on imported bitmaps. 

•	Layer  transparency effects.

•	The main tools palette is aligned vertically down the left hand side in a way that uses the

         minimum of space.

•	The import and export  in various file formats: SVG, AI, EPS, PDF PS and PNG.

•	Designed to be extensible and customised with add-ons.



 I was surprised that the interface seemed fairly intuitive and self-explanatory.     With one click on the icon, the tool is highlighted and described. 

  

It has to be said  though, that it does require time and patience to get the hang of the ‘pencil’ and ‘berzier curve tool’ but I did anticipate that this would be the case.   In addition, I found the ‘node’ tool quite hard to operate.  As this tool allows for intricate reshaping I found it difficult with small items. However, Inkscape deserves the time taken to learn all the rich functions and hopefully when I become more confident my opinion will be more positive. 

There is a vast array of official and external video tutorials to assist an user.   However, I preferred to take a more hands on approach and spent time simply trying out the various functions.   I had good fun designing 3D boxes, eclipses and circles.   The palette which houses ‘fill’ and ‘stroke’ can be displayed in a collapsible format making it easy to colour the object and I enjoyed ‘grouping’ the items together to make an array of designs.



If the company’s main objective is to provide a user-friendly suite of applications and an easy to use desk-top then they have certainly fulfilled that criteria. 



The website is clear and concise with a lay-out which is easy to navigate and garner information.  A badly designed website can put me off the product but I had no worries on this score as I found the colour scheme easy on the eye.



Inkscape is downloaded on my computer and I hope that through the mountain of reading and assignments I can get the time to become more confident and competent in its use.  I strongly believe that Inkscape should be on DiRT Directory as it is a viable option for scholarly research for those in universities, colleges and schools; and an option for individuals starting up as freelance researchers, in addition to the potential use for all creatives, business people or anyone that wants to make their documents much more interesting to read.

Promoted features include connecting with communities who share your interests, learning from users who work in your field, the ability to share your discoveries with friends, and taking a "deep dive on any topic."
According to Aria Haghighi, one of the founders "...we have an architecture similar to a search engine: polling and crawling the open web and activity on social networks." A 2013 article on Slate.com refers to Prismatic as "the world's smartest news reader". It's a good addition to other search and curation tools such as Google Alerts and saved Twitter hashtag searches.

For the purposes of review, I have chosen a tool called 'Ainm.ie'. It is an online database which consists of approximately 1700 biographies for individuals who have made a significant contribution to the Irish language over the past 5 centuries. My goal is to use it as a resource for my dissertation (" 'Sun Tzu Is Ainm Dom': Ireland's Language and Its Military Diaspora"). To that end, I have been searching Ainm.ie for figures connected to both the Irish language and military history. So far, I have searched for individuals based on the following criteria:
1: Each candidate must have a connection to Irish military history (a field which is at times difficult to separate from overall military history).
2: Definition of a connection: a person of Irish descent who has engaged in military service on behalf of a foreign power in an army, marine (in the case of Britain or the US), naval or air capacity.
3: If an individual is related to a figure who has engaged in such activities, this is also acceptable.
4: Also counted amongst my choices are individuals who have aided war efforts in civilian capacities, e.g. propaganda campaigns, recruitment  drives, diplomacy or intelligence work.
5: They must also have made a positive contribution to the Irish language, or have used it to some extent during wartime.
6: The (surprisingly large) number of people with no Irish connection but who have served in military conflicts will not be included for the purposes of this particular study.
7: Those who may have served in the Irish army are not mentioned as I do not count them as part of the military diaspora.
Based upon said qualifications, I have chosen 90 people (so far). In order to understand my choice of Ainm.ie as a research tool, it is first necessary to understand my reasons for choosing my research topic. I want (insofar as it's possible) to tell the story of Irish speakers at war, because it's something which I feel has been neglected. Because this is a very much a niche topic, it has proven impossible for me to rely solely on conventional digital tools. Simply typing the phrase 'Irish (or Gaelic) speakers in the British (or American/French/, etc.) army' into Google, Google Scholar or DuckDuckGo does not guarantee a result. It has even been necessary for much of the time to consult non-digital resources. Since my goal has been to create a digital artifact using any and all means at my disposal, I have had to content myself with a lack of digital tools at my disposal. 
Ainm.ie has, however, been an exception due to the sheer volume of information it contains. Here is a breakdown of how the site's functions relevant to my work:

Search engine

This is the most basic function on the sight and it has the standard function of any website search engine. Beneath it, there is another search button for more specialized searches involving 'keywords' and 'phrases'. I have used this many times for military terms such as 'soldier(s)', 'war(s)', 'military', 'regiment(s)', 'brigade(s)', etc. The site is mostly in Irish. Changes in spelling and grammar are important when deciding what phrase to search for. Take for example if one searches for the phrase briogáid (the Irish for 'brigade' in the nominative case), the same results will usually be yielded if he/she uses bhriogáid (the dative case equivalent).

Alphabetical list

This enables the user to search for individuals by the first letter of their surname. Highly useful, but a distinction must be made between "Ó" and "O' " at the start of some names, and also between names rendered wholly in Irish or English.

Themes

Searches can be carried under the following headings: placenames, works, the Gaelic League, educational institutions, professions and political parties. In my view, this section has its drawbacks because the part dealing with placenames is limited insofar as one cannot search for South Africa, even though references are made to the Boer War. The 'professions' search is also problematic, because although one can find 'SMYTHE, William James' under the title 'soldier', because he is tagged as such in his entry's information box (see next entry), having spent a good deal of his life in the Royal Artillery. Ó FLAITHEARTA, Liam cannot be found under same, because even though he fought in the Irish Guards during the First World War, he is not tagged as a soldier. The reasons for such distinctions are not made clear. Ó Flaithearta left the army after the war. Ó CATHÁIN, Seán (1889–1948) was in the US army at the same time, and left the army after the war, but he is tagged with Smythe.

Information box

Each individual biographical entry contains a box on the left-hand corner containing basic details such as place of birth, gender, school, higher education and writer. The place of birth section because it provides a link to 'logainm.ie', a website which provides information in both English and Irish regarding Irish placenames. Some entries also contain a profession section, where those with similar professions are usually tagged together, but with some exceptions (see previous entry)
In spite of the few disadvantages outlined above, I have found 'Ainm.ie' to be the best digital for my subject matter so far. As it is my intention to create a digital artifact on the links between the Irish language and military history, it has been an invaluable aid for biographical details.

The Macro-Etymological Analyzer is a web app for text analysis that will look up every word of your text in the Etymological Wordnet, and generate statistics about the macro-etymology of your text, organized by language family. For instance, it can analyze a novel and tell you the proportions of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, or of Afroasiatic origin. First-generation and second-generation language ancestor data is included, and the output is highly granular, allowing the scholar to see the origins of individual words, and statistics about each ancestor language. This data can be useful as a particular type of topic modeling, since some macro-etymological data have have been correlated with particular genres, as well as the ages and sexes of their authors and/or speaking characters. For more details, read the introductory blog post and see these example experiments.

Kartograph is a pair of free and open source libraries for representing data with a spatial component on webpages or in print. The first library, Kartograph.py, is a Python library that builds lightweight vector graphic maps from either shapefiles or PostGIS tables. These graphics files can be styled either using a cascading style sheet during creation or later on the second library, Kartograph.js. The vector files can also be edited and enhanced in a vector graphics program like Adobe Illustrator.
Kartograph.js allows the user to create interactive maps for web pages and web applications, using vector graphics files and data files to both draw the basemap and the features of interest. Unlike many web-based mapping libraries, Kartograph.js requires no server or even internet connection. All of the pertinent information is in the vector and data files. The results are highly customizable and can absolutely arresting, visually.

This product can filter or format text-based content. It also includes a document or link organiser and search capabilities and might more correctly be termed a text management system. With the large number of documents stored on your computer and online links that you might use, this is a helpful application that allows you to navigate the environment more easily. Although the feature set is now well developed, an inexperienced user should still be able to use it relatively easily. It is not intended only for the expert managers.
The key features of the application are therefore as follows:
1. The ability to read text, XML, or parse the contents of PDF or online content (HTML). Binary (Microsoft Office) files are included in the professional version.
2. A set of filter operations that can be applied in sequences, saved and retrieved.
3. A set of folders can be used as default locations for all of your related data. The application runs locally only, there is no requirement for a remote server.
4. A grid or tabular format allows you to view database queries, or for operations over specific columns or cells. A log file might have a standard format that can be queried, or conversion to CSV might be required, for example.
5. An analysis panel allows you to select single or groups of files and compare the content based on known clustering algorithms. Also some basic statistical counts.
6. Basic search from a toolbar, or more complex search operations from a Query form. The search facilities allow you to find information from different views and query types.
7. A separate Organiser application allows you to store your online links or local files, into ordered books and categories that can also be searched over. This allows for querying most of the available information, including keywords, descriptions, notes and content.
8. A Bookmarks form displays a list of ordered file references or links, for any type of file. You can open one of your commonly viewed files or links through a single click.

nodegoat is a web-based data management, analysis & visualisation environment.
Using nodegoat, you can define, create, update, query, and manage any number of datasets by use of a graphic user interface. Your custom data model autoconfigures the backbone of notegoat's core functionalities.
Within nodegoat you are able to instantly analyse and visualise datasets. nodegoat allows you to enrich data with relational, geographical and temporal attributes. Therefore, the modes of analysis are inherently diachronic and ready-to-use for interactive maps and extensive trailblazing.
In order to share the functionalities of nodegoat with the scholarly community, scholars and research institutes are invited to use nodegoat for their own research purposes. Send an email to info@lab1100.com to discuss using nodegoat for your research projects.
nodegoat allows scholars to build datasets based on their own data model and offers relational modes of analysis with spatial and chronological forms of contextualisation. By combining these elements within one environment, scholars are able to instantly process, analyse and visualise complex datasets relationally, diachronically and spatially; trailblazing.
nodegoat follows an object-oriented approach throughout its core functionalities. Borrowing from actor-network theory this means that people, events, artefacts, and sources are treated as equal: objects, and hierarchy depends solely on the composition of the network: relations. This object-oriented approach advocates the self-identification of individual objects and maps the correlation of objects within the collective.
nodegoat can host multiple projects with different relational data models and manage users with various privileges and project affiliations. With the integration of version history and dynamic discussion fields, users can work on and discuss different aspects of the datasets without losing any data in the process.
Scholars define their own data models freely and dynamically with no limitations to relational structures or depths. This model allows for filtering and analysis of complex relations between objects in your datasets. Paths between different objects can be analysed to expose relational networks. As each object can be supplemented with geographical and temporal attributes, diachronic geographic and social visualisations of your datasets are directly available.
nodegoat is capable of processing complex queries. In nodegoat you query your data by means of filtering functionalities. These filters are based on the data model that has been set up and are as complex or as simple. Also, these filters will go as deep as the connections that can be made within the data model. Each filter can be stored and re-used by other users and can be used for various functionalities within a research project. For instance, once a filter has been stored a user can ‘follow’ a filter and be notified when an object matching this filter has been added or modified.
nodegoat allows scholars to define in-text references to any object in your dataset. Example: should you include a transcript of a meeting, you can 'tag' people or organisations mentioned in this transcript. The database will save this reference as a relation between the object of the person/organisation and the object of the meeting.
nodegoat is built to be fully platform independent. It is possible to import complex and relational datasets from file and to export clean relational datasets in standard JSON or XML formatting.

JuxtaposeJS helps tell stories by comparing two image frames, including photos and gifs. It provides a means, by a draggable pane, to see the changes and visually analyse the differences between the two images.
It’s an adaptable storytelling tool that is ideal for highlighting then/now stories that explain slow changes over time (growth of a city skyline, regrowth of a forest, etc.) or before/after stories that show the impact of single dramatic events (natural disasters, protests, wars, etc.).
JuxtaposeJS is free, easy to use, and open source. Almost anyone can use JuxtaposeJS, so long as you’ve got links to two similar pieces of media (hosted on your own server or on Flickr). Once you’ve got the links, all you need to do is copy and paste the URLs into the appropriate fields at Juxtapose.knightlab.com, modify labels as you see fit, add photo credits, and then copy and paste the resulting embed code into your site.
You’ve probably seen similar photo slider tools elsewhere. They work well, but we built JuxtaposeJS without relying on jQuery, which makes the tool more lightweight, flexible, and adaptable. It’s also accessible to any newsroom or journalist, regardless of technical skills.

It also offers some customization out of the box. You can modify the handle’s start position to highlight the area of change and choose to click the slider instead of dragging. It is responsive and works on phones and tablets with the touch or swipe of a finger.

What's worse than a leaking wall? A soaked basement! It is no doubt that a wet basement can be a nightmare for any home owner. Water exactly isn't a friend when it causes persistent leaks or dampness in the walls and basement of your home. If you have, by any chance, experienced the horrible phase of soaked and wet basement then it is probably in your best interests that you get your basement waterproofed. As you never know, when is the next time you find yourself in the same situation again? But there are number of ways in which you can tackle this problem and hiring a professional contractor for basement waterproofing is one solution.
The choice is yours- you can either hire professionals or seek professional advice such as the suggestions given below. Just find the ones which are most effective for your basement problems.What should you do when you first notice water in your basement? Start investigating outside the house. Your aim should be to find the manner in which water is making its way into your basement. Also make sure that the downspouts, gutters or any other drainage systems of your home are working effectively and doing its task of diverting the water away from your home. Keep the maintenance of your home in check- that's the key!
With basement waterproofing, each situation is unique. Any good contractor will agree to the fact that one size doesn't fit all. Avoid systems that are not specifically designed for the situation you have- that is quite preventive against any problem to occur in near future. Your contractor must know what each problem of basement water id unique and requires different solutions. Most of them occur due to a majority of factors and that makes it all the more essential to invest in a good basement waterproofing system.
The kind of basement waterproofing system you need to install depends upon your home's unique construction and situation including the kind of foundation system in place. It is also necessary that you know that many times just one repair isn't enough, you may have to go with a combination of approaches.It is one waterproofing method that many contractors do not recommend. According to them, a covering over a wall with leaks produces cosmetic solution if the source of leak isn't taken care of in time.
This basement waterproofing technique is mostly suited for concrete foundations as seepage is through walls and not floors. The basic masonry elements like bricks, cinder block or stone aren't exactly what you would want. However water can be prevented from entering into the wall or basement by injecting a polyurethane or epoxy. However, many basement waterproofing companies call it a Band-Aid solution.This technique involves excavating down the foundation wall footer (6 to 8 ft.) and installing a French drain system or installing drainage tiles and hence correcting the drainage system.

Bookworm is a tool that visualizes language usage trends in repositories of digitized texts in a simple and powerful way. It is a tool for culturomic exploration through the observation of chronological trends for words and phrases in large digitized collections of textual documents with metadata facets.

The world's great research libraries have, over time, carefully assembled a rich body of metadata pertaining to the books in their collections. Since the HTRC has access to volume-level metadata as well as volume-level content, we have constructed a Bookworm of the HathiTrust Non-Google-digitized public domain (NGPD) corpus. We felt that setting up Bookworm with a HathiTrust corpus would provides scholarly researchers with the means of exploring trends.

This tool enables scholars to discover new textual use patterns across the entire corpus. In the future, we plan to ingest the entire HathiTrust corpus and continue to identify appropriate metadata to use for the faceted browsing. This tool will be particularly useful to scholars interested in books that are still under copyright - which is the case for most books published after 1923. Although these books will not be available for reading or downloading online, working with individual words and phrases and tracking their occurrences through time will be useful to academic researchers, especially historians, sociologists and literary scholars.

John Unsworth has noted that a fundamental goal of the humanities is appreciation: "by paying attention to an object of interest, we can explore it, find new dimensions within it, notice things about it that have never been noticed before, and increase its value" (2004). Shifting from traditional close reading to a large-scale view of text presents a profound discomfort for humanities scholars, due to the difficulty in retaining the same sensitivity to what is actually contained in the works being studied. HTRC-Bookworm will function as a link between quantitative analysis (distant reading) and close reading. According to Frederick Gibbs and Daniel Cohen, "any robust digital research methodology must allow the scholar to move easily between distant and close reading, between the bird's eye view and the ground level of the texts themselves" (2011). This is what HTRC-Bookworm intends to accomplish (within the limitations of applicable copyright laws.)

Current limitations and future improvements:

The current instantiation (the alpha version) of the HTRC-Bookworm is set up to work with only 250,000 out-of-copyright volumes from the HathiTrust NGPD corpus. Overall the HathiTrust has more than 11,000,000 volumes in all their corpus, consisting of 420 billion pages.

As a demonstration we have selected some metadata for use with this smaller corpus, but we are open to feedback on improvements to this metadata.

Our plan is to ingest the larger HathiTrust corpus and to allow facets to be selected based on HTRC worksets.

BibSonomy is a social bookmarking and publication-sharing system. It aims to integrate the features of bookmarking systems as well as team-oriented publication management. BibSonomy offers users the ability to store and organize their bookmarks and publication entries and supports the integration of different communities and people by offering a social platform for literature exchange.

Both bookmarks and publication entries can be tagged to help structure and re-find information. As the descriptive terms can be freely chosen, the assignment of tags from different users creates a spontaneous, uncontrolled vocabulary: a folksonomy. In BibSonomy, the folksonomy evolves from the participation of research groups, learning communities and individual users, organizing their information needs.

Publication posts in BibSonomy are stored in the BibTeX format. Export in other formats such as EndNote or HTML (e. g. for publication list creation) is possible.

The service was developed by a team of students and scientists working at the Institute of Knowledge and Data Engineering and is hosted by the University of Kassel in Germany.

One of the substantial tasks in the ﬁeld of textual criticism is called collation, which is the cautious comparison of various editions of one and the same text. The traditional approach of a humanities scholar is to put the texts of several editions next to each other and mark the differences among the textual entities (e.g., sentences, sections, chapters). Since this is an extremely laborious approach many Digital Humanities projects investigate tools that support the humanities scholars with computational methods.
TRAViz is a JavaScript library that was developed within the Digital Humanities project eTRACES. It generates visualizations for Text Variant Graphs that show the variations between different editions of texts. TRAViz supports the collation task by providing methods to:
- align various editions of a text
- visualize the alignment
- improve the readability for Text Variant Graphs compared to other approaches
- interact with the graph to discover how individual editions disseminate

Writefull is a light-weight app that uses data from Google Books (5+ million books) and the Web to improve your writing, It compares small sections of your text to a large data set of writing found online and in Google Books. All you need to do is select a chunk of your text in your browser or text editing software, activate the Writefull popover, and choose one of its five options: 



1) check the number of results (how often the chunk appears in Google Books or the Web); 

2) compare the number of results (if your selected chunk appears more or less frequently than suggestions from online);

3) see examples in context (display several examples of how your selected chunk is used in different texts); 

4) find words in context (see which words are used most often in your context, which you specify in your text by a star. For example, 'research should * this issue' will give you a list with 'research should address this issue', 'research should explore this issue', 'research should examine this issue', etc.); 

5) find synonyms in context (see which synonyms of a word are used most often in your context, with you specifying the word you want synonyms for by two stars. For example: 'a *difficult* situation' will suggest 'an awkward situation', 'a serious situation', 'an embarrassing situation', etc). 



The app works with a small popover which mean you can activate it from whatever writing tool you're using. No need to change windows - no interruption of your workflow. 



N.B. Writefull 2.0 will be launching soon and will eliminate the need to purchase queries in the Web version. The $5 membership fee still applies.

Ptolemaic is a computer application for music visualization and analysis written in the Java programming language. The software is designed to aid in the analysis of all types of Western music using established analytical techniques, including tonal functional analysis (Harrison 1994), pitch-class set analysis (Forte 1973), hierarchical linear analysis (Schenker 1935, Jones 2002), tonal pitch-space analysis on the Tonnetz (Riemann 1915), pitch-class set analysis (Forte 1973), and transformation analysis (Lewin 1987). Musical works and excerpts may be opened and saved using the de-facto standard music notation interchange format, MusicXML. To assist in analysis, Ptolemaic can display the music on a pitch/time graph, on a pitch-class/time graph, on a step-class/time graph (also called a diatonic lattice) (Jones 2002), on the Tonnetz, or using filtered point-symmetry (Douthett 2008). Pitch classes and chords are color coded so that the user can easily correlate them across each graph. The benefit of having a software tool to visualize and perform certain analysis tasks is in automating processes that are normally time-consuming for the musician, thus allowing the music scholar to focus on the musical issues, rather than the technical issues of graphing, and calculating chord classes. Ptolemaic provides useful ways of visualizing a piece of music and tools for gaining more information about that music, so that the user can efficiently make informed musical decisions about the music and preserve that analysis for future study.

NewRadial is an interactive visualization environment that uses an adapter system to display and combine content from remotely-served or locally situated databases.  Although initially designed for use with image-based databases, NewRadial’s capabilities have been extended to handle the manipulation and annotation, in a visual field, of text-based databases.  This  adaptive ability makes it ideal for use with literary works, and—given its web-based functionality--ideal for collecting, associating and displaying independent databases together in the same visual field for use by a particular knowledge community.  
The NewRadial prototype encourages three types of work:
1.	 A simple search, sorting and manipulation of database objects in a visual field for the purposes of early scholarly inquiry and curiosity-based research
2.	Initial, raw and in-process commentary on connections and associations between database objects.  Within the database’s visual field, scholars can add comments on such correlations, thus starting conversations, discussions and debates relating to such ideas.  These discussions are hosted and archived by the NewRadial server.
3.	Larger edition projects in which a community is able to centralize and sort specific selections from a larger database.  NewRadial can be used to construct these curated environments, browse such environments, and (if desired) encourage secondary scholarship to proliferate in and around such projects.

Silk is a platform for sites that contain collections of information. It's like the Tumblr for websites that have structured content–like software reviews, information about designers, a site with UN datasets, and more.

When you have created your site (manually or by uploading one or more datasets), you can visualize and filter your data in a few ways. You can create graphs if your pages contain numbers, maps if you have locations, and filtered tables for just about anything. These visualizations and tables are interactive: anyone can play around with the variables to get the answer they need from the data.

Bibliopedia will perform advanced data-mining and cross-referencing of scholarly literature to create a humanities-centered collaboratory. As a prototype, it will search resources including JSTOR and Library of Congress for metadata about scholarly articles and books that mention the famed medieval travel narrative The Travels of Sir John Mandeville, examine the articles and books for citations, then save the results in a publicly accessible database. Although using works centered around a single text as a test case, Bibliopedia will be designed to work with all humanities scholarship. Bibliopedia will also allow users to create browsable and customizable bibliographies of all the works cited by each article and book. Most importantly, it will use semantic web technology to perform automated textual analysis, data extraction, cross-referencing, and visualizations of the relationships among texts and authors.

Bibliopedia will crawl, aggregate, cross-reference, and display multiple scholarly repositories such as JSTOR, Library of Congress, Project Muse, and Google Books. The project will transform bibliographic data that is currently readable only by humans into machine-readable data via semantic web technology, which will make scholarly resources available for automated analyses, inferences, and visualizations.

Participad is a WordPress plugin that allows multiple people to edit the same WP content at the same time. Powered by Etherpad Lite, Participad gives you: notepads for collaborative notetaking; synchronous authoring of any content in the WordPress Dashboard; front-end editing. You can download it from the WordPress plugin repository. 
Participad has three modules: 
Dashboard – The Dashboard module puts Etherpad editors into the WordPress Dashboard. Participad removes the “Visual” and “HTML” tabs from the standard WP editor, and replaces them with a “Participad” tab.
Frontend – The Frontend module allows users to edit WordPress content from the front end of your website – no Dashboard required. Participad modifies the Edit links on your posts and pages so that, instead of leading to the Dashboard, the static content of your post is swapped with an editable Etherpad window.
Notepad – The Notepad module enables a new WordPress Post Type called Notepads. Notepads are collaborative note-taking documents, which can optionally be linked to existing static posts or pages. Participad provides several shortcodes and widgets that make it easy to create new Notepads from the front end of your website.
 N.B. Participad requires a separate Etherpad Lite Installation.

The Classical Text Editor was designed to enable scholars working on a critical edition or on a text with commentary or translation to prepare a camera-ready copy or electronic publication without bothering much about making up and page proofs. Its features, formed in continuous discussion with editors using the program, meet the practical needs of the scholar concerning text constitution, entries to different apparatus and updating them when the text has been changed, as well as creating and redefining sigla. The possibility to search for and visualise manuscript constellations may be of considerable help in detecting affiliations between sources. It is the primary purpose of the Classical Text Editor to do the automatable work which consumes so much time and energy, and let the scholar concentrate on scientific issues.

Editors' Notes is an open-source, web-based tool for recording, organizing, preserving, and opening access to research notes, built with the needs of documentary editing projects, archives, and library special collections in mind.
Projects that work closely with documents—researching, contextualizing, and ordering them—invariably produce massive amounts of thorough research notes which are too often locked away in filing cabinets or the minds of editors and curators, never to be seen by anyone. The Editors' Notes project is a collaboration between the editors of the Stanton-Anthony Papers, the Emma Goldman Papers, the Margaret Sanger Papers, and the Labadie Collection which aims to preserve those research notes in a way that makes them useful to future scholars and interested minds.
Research teams can use Editors' Notes to manage their research and note-taking. Project administrators can assign research tasks to other team members, and they can control who has permission to edit their project's notes. 
Notes can be organized around documentary sources or thematically around topics (or both). Users can browse by topic, search full text, and filter using bibliographic metadata. Documents can be annotated with bibliographic metadata, topic keywords, and textual notations. Researchers can also upload scanned images of documents into the zoomable interface. Researchers can annotate specific passages in document transcripts. Annotations, like other notes, can include bibliographic metadata and topic keywords and are fully searchable. In addition to creating annotated transcripts, researchers can upload scanned images of documents, which can be viewed in a zoomable interface.
New accounts are by invitation only. Request an invitation. Editors' Notes is currently in limited beta release (Nov 10/14)

The cross-platform Advene application allows users to easily create comments and analyses of video documents, through the definition of time-aligned annotations and their mobilisation into
automatically-generated or user-written comment views (HTML documents). Annotations can also be used to modify the rendition of the audiovisual document, thus providing virtual montage, captioning, navigation... capabilities. Users can exchange their comments/analyses in the form of Advene packages, independently from the video itself.
The Advene framework provides models and tools allowing to design and reuse annotations schemas; annotate video streams according to these schemas; generate and create Stream-Time Based (mainly video-centred) or User-Time Based (mainly text-centred) visualisations of the annotations. Schemas (annotation- and relation-types), annotations and relations, queries and views can be clustered and shared in units called packages. Hypervideo documents are generated when needed, both from packages (for annotation and view description) and DVDs (audiovisual streams).

The term "lexomics" was originally coined to describe the computer-assisted detection of "words" (short sequences of bases) in genomes. When applied to literature as we do here, lexomics is the analysis of the frequency, distribution, and arrangement of words in large-scale patterns. The current suite of lexomics tools are:
scrubber -- strips tags, removes stop words, applies lemma lists, and prepares texts for diviText

diviText -- cuts texts into chunks in one of three ways, count words, exports the results

treeView -- builds dendrograms and saves the output as .pdf or xml in phyloXML format

The Lexomics web site site contains extensive documentation and video tutorials.
Note: Lexomics has been replaced Lexos, which offers an integrated workflow and additional functionality.

Combined with the Leptonica Image Processing Library Tesseract can read a wide variety of image formats and convert them to text in over 40 languages.

This code is a raw OCR engine. It has no output formatting and no UI. It can detect fixed pitch vs proportional text. Nevertheless in 1995 this engine was in the top 3 in terms of character accuracy, and it compiles and runs on both Linux and Windows. Training code is included in the open source release.

The core developer on the project is Ray Smith (theraysmith).

Thomas Breuel (tmbdev) and Ilya Mezhirov (mezhirov) work on the OCRopus project, for which Tesseract is one of the pluggable OCR engines; OCRopus also provides layout analysis and statistical language modeling.

Most of the work on Tesseract is sponsored by Google.

The goal of the Alpheios project is to help people learn how to learn languages as efficiently and enjoyably as possible, and in a way that best helps them understand their own literary heritage and culture, and the literary heritage and culture of other peoples throughout history. One of the principal tools, a Firefox plugin, allows a reader to browse a web page with Latin, ancient Greek, or Arabic, click on a word, and get a definition and morphological analysis of the word.
Initial focus is on classical literature in languages no longer spoken, such as Latin and ancient Greek, but will eventually include a wide variety of languages, ancient and modern. By sharing these tools and the source code in which they are written freely on the Web, the Alpheios Project also hopes to encourage their collaborative development.
The software as of July 2012 is in Beta release, with all the caveats normally associated with that level of development.
Other tools under development include a treebank editor, an alignment editor, text analysis software, and learning management software.

WebLicht is a service-oriented architecture (SOA) for creating annotated text corpora. Development started in October 2008 as part of CLARIN-D's predecessor project D-SPIN, and further development and enhancement of WebLicht is an important goal of CLARIN-D, aiming to make WebLicht a fully-functional virtual research environment.
WebLicht employs chains of RESTful web services. Each web service encapsulates a certain linguistic tool. For example, users can access as a web service the query component of a corpus, a format converter, a tokenizer, a tagger, or a parser. Translation between the input format specific to some tool and the WebLicht information interchange format TCF (see below) is performed by a web service wrapper. Each web service adds at least one layer of annotation encompassing the work of the tool encapsulated by that service. The output of a chain of WebLicht services is an automatically analyzed corpus in the form of an XML document.
To do this, each WebLicht service must be able to use a common interchange format that all the other services can also process. CLARIN-D's Text Corpus Format (TCF), serves this purpose. It is broadly compatible with existing related interchange formats like Negra, Paula, or TüBa-D/Z, and format-specific converters allow interchange between them.
WebLicht can be accessed only with a valid DFN-AAI/Shibboleth-based account or a local Tübingen account.

ANNIS is an open source, cross platform (Linux, Mac, Windows), web browser-based search and visualization architecture for complex multi-layer linguistic corpora with diverse types of annotation. ANNIS, which stands for ANNotation of Information Structure, was originally designed to provide access to the data of the SFB 632 - “Information Structure: The Linguistic Means for Structuring Utterances, Sentences and Texts”. It has since then been extended to a large number of projects annotating a variety of phenomena. Since complex linguistic phenomena such as information structure interact on many levels, ANNIS addresses the need to concurrently annotate, query and visualize data from such varied areas as syntax, semantics, morphology, prosody, referentiality, lexis and more. For projects working with spoken language, support for audio / video annotations is also required.
Data is often annotated using both automatic taggers/parsers and a growing set of manual annotation tools (e.g. EXMARaLDA, ELAN, annotate/Synpathy, MMAX, RSTTool, Arborator, WebAnno, Atomic), ANNIS provides the means for visualizing and retrieving this data. Pepper is used to import the multiple annotation formats into ANNIS.
